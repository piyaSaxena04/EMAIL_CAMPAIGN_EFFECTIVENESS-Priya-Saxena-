The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model designed to categorize and oversee email marketing messages originating from Gmail. Targeted at small to medium business proprietors, the aim is to optimize the efficiency of their email campaigns and boost customer retention.

An inherent challenge in email marketing lies in discerning which emails are read, ignored, or acknowledged by recipients. To tackle this challenge, the project will gather data on various email attributes such as subject lines, sender names, content, formats, frequencies, target audiences, and other pertinent factors.

Utilizing this dataset, the project will train a machine learning model to predict whether an email is likely to be read, ignored, or acknowledged by the recipient. The model will then assess new emails, providing predictions on how they are expected to be received.

To gauge the model's efficacy, the project will partition the data into a training set and a testing set. The training set will be employed to refine the model, while the testing set will evaluate its accuracy and effectiveness through metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score.

Upon successful training and evaluation, the model can be deployed in a live environment, offering support to small to medium business owners in enhancing the impact of their email marketing initiatives. Through the model's analysis and monitoring of emails, business owners can make informed decisions about targeting their marketing strategies and enhancing customer retention.

In essence, this project seeks to furnish small to medium business owners with a valuable tool, utilizing machine learning to classify and monitor emails, thereby improving the efficacy of their email marketing campaigns.
